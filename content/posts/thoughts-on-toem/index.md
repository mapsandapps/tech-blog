## Mechanics I Liked

* Just a small thing, but I like how the different shoes affected your walk speed & sound
* Stamps mechanic: cute, and also allowed you to put difficult quests aside for a while and move on to another zone (and also have quests that covered multiple zones)
* You can even win the game without completing all the quests. I think there are probably very few specific quests that you have to complete to finish (possibly none beyond the first zone?); it’s more about getting the bus tickets
* The different "modes" of walking & photographing


## Mechanics I Didn't Like

* Took me a while to figure out what I did and didn’t need to take photos of. I started out taking photos of anything targetable, which includes trees and rocks for some reason, not just things in the compendium


## Visual Design

* It was interesting that there were a couple times they used color
* Interesting how the maps were 2d and then the camera view was 3d and often showed things like doors that the maps didn’t show


## Things That Resonated With Me


## Things I Think Will Stick With Me


## Why I'm Still Playing It/Why I Stopped Playing It

* 100% done; not really any replayability


## Other

* Only needed a couple of hints near the end, but it didn’t feel too easy, either
* Had to adjust the controls to make it feel natural, but they were configurable enough for that to work
* There were a few things that seemed like there should be more there (e.g. a quest) but that didn’t have them
* It left me with some questions, like: what is this cosmo deer about? 🤔
* Music & audio design was great
* It’s the kind of game that works better if you keep notes and/or a map, but they aren’t required at all

## Final Thought

It’s pretty great if you like cute lil adventure games. I rate it 👍👍
